## License Summary

### License Distribution
- **Apache-2.0**: 6 dependencies (tcell, cobra, encoding, mousetrap, godebug, openai)
- **MIT**: 7 dependencies (fuzzy, go-colorful, go-runewidth, uniseg, textual, rich, rapidfuzz)
- **BSD-3-Clause**: 7 dependencies (pflag, golang.org/x/* packages, pyperclip, prompt-toolkit)
- **Coffee License**: 1 dependency (autocd-go)

### Important Notes

1. **Optional Dependencies**: Many Python projects are designed to work with optional dependencies (pyperclip, rapidfuzz, etc.), gracefully degrading functionality when packages aren't available. This means users can run the tools even without installing all dependencies.

2. **Coffee License Dependency**: The `autocd-go` library uses The Coffee License, which allows free use for entities under $500M valuation and requires a $50 commercial license for larger entities.

3. **Golang Extended Packages**: All `golang.org/x/*` packages are part of the Go extended standard library and use BSD-3-Clause licensing.

4. **Commercial Use**: Most dependencies use permissive licenses (Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD-3-Clause) that allow commercial use without restrictions. Only `autocd-go` has valuation-based licensing terms.

For the most up-to-date license information, always check the official repositories listed above.
