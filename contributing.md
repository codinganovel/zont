# Contributing

Thanks for your interest!

### ðŸ›  How to contribute
- Fork the repo
- Make your changes in a clean, minimal PR
- Explain the *why* of your change â€” not just the *what*

### ðŸ’¡ Feature suggestions
Feel free to open issues for anything youâ€™d like to see. If it fits the "low-friction versioning" philosophy, weâ€™ll talk.

### âœ… Style
- Keep it readable
- No dependencies â€” this should stay portable and lightweight
